# Describe the data and the problem

I am interested in what will affect housing price by building perdictive model.

We have the some interesting features in our dataset, 

for instance, 


$black$

1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.

$crim$

per capita crime rate by town.

## How would these enviornment variables affect a house's value?

We can use linear model to find out the relationship between them.

I found this data set from our class repo, more information could be found at
